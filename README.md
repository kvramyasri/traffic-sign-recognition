<h3> Traffic Sign Recognition </h3>
</br>
<h5> Description </h5>
Traffic sign recongnition is a system used in self driving cars and driving assistance systems for automatic detection of various traffic signs and act or guide according to the sign</br>
This system will assistant humans when then exceed any traffic limit in driving assistance systems </br>
This system directs the car according to the traffic sign in the self driving cars </br>
In this project, we used deep neural networks - convolutional neural network and VGG16 for developing traffic sign recognition system </br>
We used German dataset which consists around 50,000 images and 43 classes for developing this model </br>
</br>
<h5> Objectives </h5>
In this project, we are building a neural network model for the German Dataset which detects the particular image type and gives the description of the image i.e, about anyone of the traffic sign </br>
In the real-time implementation of this model, it predicts the traffic sign with high accuracy </br>
we are developing a web interface for the model </br>
</br>
<h5> Scope </h5>
This model can help self-driving cars to recognize traffic signs </br>
The model will assist the drivers by recognizing the traffic sign </br>
Traffic sign recognition has become an important research topic in the area of convolution neural network </br>
In the future, we will implement the traffic sign capture and  recognition over video datasets </br>
</br> 
<h5> Technologies and libraries used </h5>
Python </br>
Flask </br>
TensorFlow</br>
Numpy </br>
Pandas </br>
OpenCv </br>
Keras </br>
gTTS </br>
Translate </br>
PIL </br>
mathplot </br>
</br>
<h5> Features </h5>
it classifies a traffic sign image from the 43 class types </br>
it classifies the image and play the audio to the meaning of traffic sign </br>
will classify the meaning and translate the meaning of traffic sign to preferred language </br>
